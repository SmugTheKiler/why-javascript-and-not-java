# why-javascript-and-not-java

Why I feel like learning JavaScript is wayy better than Java.


## 1: HTML Programming
You can put JavaScript into HTML, and make awesome things with it.
Even tho Java can also be in a website, browsers have lots of things
for it like debuggers implimented right into it, and more browsers 
support it then Java.

## 2: Simplisity
For the kids that learn it in school, honestly, JavaScript is better.
Its a good language to get into the world of programming and to begin
with, since it's used in lots of places, and is more simple, or at least,
it looks and is easier to learn for the very new beginers. They don't
have to put things such as <>, or ** somewhere. In JavaScript on other
hand, you can just do stuff like ```const constant = require('package') ```

## 3: Identical Languages
As I've seen, there are multiple languages that look just like JavaScript,
meaning they will be able to learn pretty much multiple languages with just
learning one of them.
Some examples of that I know of:

- TypeScript
- CoffeeScript
- Dart 

## 4: Variety of packages
If you use a browser and search something like, "How many python packages are there?",
you will see its arround 330k. If you replace Python with JavaScript, its going to say
***1.3 Million***, meaning there are more interesting packages for users to use, and
to explrore in their personal projects.

### Fun Fact: NPM is the biggest package registry in the World.

My personal projects done with JavaScript:

+ ${Ella}

- Discord Verified
- With over 135k users
- Made entirly out of plain JavaScript and packages of NPM...
